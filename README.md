# dotfiles

Dotfiles for:
- Alacritty
- Neovim, with Vim-plug
- Tmux
- Zsh, with Antibody

The `install.sh` is used to install Homebrew and vim-plug, and to run `brew bundle`.
After that, sourcing `init.vim` and running `:PlugInstall` should install all vim plugins.
Antibody installs plugins automatically.
