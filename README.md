Dotfiles for:
- Alacritty
- Neovim
- Tmux
- Zsh

The `install.sh` is used to install Homebrew and vim-plug, and to run `brew bundle`.
After that, sourcing init.vim and running `:PlugInstall` should install all vim plugins.
Homebrew installs antibody, a zsh plugin manager. Antibody installs plugins automatically.
